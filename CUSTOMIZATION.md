The most important customization for the web interface is the possibility to add your own tile types.
To do so, add an htl file with th e name <type>.html to the folder 'templaces/tiles' and add the static resources
'<type>.css' and '<type>.js' to the folder 'static/tiles'. You have to do so, even if you dont need javascript or custom
stylesheets. Just leave them empty in that case.
