Ham is not Spam - yet another Homie And Mqtt based domotica project

Goal
====
The goal of the project is to produce an easy extendible affordable domotica project for home uses.
Since I want to use a Raspberry py as the main server of the project, I want every component to be very lightweight with as few dependencies as possible.
